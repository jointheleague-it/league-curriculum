# League Curriculum

A static website with links to League curriculum and documentation for how to manage it. 


## Development


This is a normal vuepress site, so to:

* build: `cd docs/src; yarn build`
* devel server: `cd docs/src; yarn dev` or `jtl serve`
* deploy: `jtl deploy`

The `scripts/leaguec` program generates some of the pages.
