# Using Module Repositories


In the LEAGUE's online Java curriculum, the lessons are organized
into _levels_, _modules_, _lessons_ and _assignments_.  Every level has a
whole website. For instance, here is the [website for Level 0](https://league-java.github.io/Level0/). 
Inside the level are modules,
modules are named with a number at the end, like "Module 0", and they will
have links with a large bold title on the left side of the page. Click on
that link to get the introduction to the module. For instance, here the link
to [Level0, Module 0](http://localhost:8080/Level0/lessons/Module0/)

# Fork and View Links

On that page you will see two important links: 

<img src="./fork_button.png" height="30px" >  <img src="./view_button.png" height="30px" ><br/>

The <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="./fork_button.png" height="25px" >
link will let you *fork* the module repository. Forking a repository will
make a copy of it in your GIthub account so you can work on it. 

The <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="./view_button.png" height="25px" >
link will take you to the module repository, so you can see all of the code
at once. This repository will be the *LEAGUE'S* repository, not yours, so you
can't change it, and won't see any of your changes. Visit your account to see
your version of the repository. 

If you visit one of the assignment pages, like [this one](http://localhost:8080/Level0/lessons/Module0/02_code_flow/)
you will see a  <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="./source_link.png" height="25px">
 link. This link will take you into the Module repositopry, to the specific
directory that has the assignment you are working on. 

# Fork a Module

Let's try it. Visit this page:
