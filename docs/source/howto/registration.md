# Student Registration

Go to https://curriculum.jointheleague.org/ and click on "Account Setup" in the left side menu. 
      
Or go directly to: https://curriculum.jointheleague.org/howto/account_registration.html

Send students to that link to register their account. At the bottom of the page,
is the Instructors Interface you should go their on your computer or phone.

## Instructors Interface

https://student-registration.do.jointheleague.org/acct/class

For most classes before students register, you must create a class code. You
will usually just enter your name and the location name, then hit submit to
create a generated class code, then hit submit again to save it.

That is: for the first submit, *don't* enter a class code, just your name and the location name.

You should have a new class code for every new class, even at the same location.
The interface will only show the last two weeks of classes to students, so they
won't see old class codes.

### Class Lists

Click on the class code to see the list of students who have registered, for instance:

The registration system now has two parts: students enter their name and email
first, then the Github account. Have them select the class code you recently
created ( the are MEA-G4 and SOTM-S4 for todays classes ).  On the next page is
their account name -- a two word phrase -- and a disposable email address. In
this example its: students+recursing_goldstine@jointheleague.org

If the student doesn't have a usefil email address, use this one. You will get
the Github confirmation code to the google group "students@jointheleague.org"
which I have added you to, so you should see the emails in your email client.

You will get a lot of them, and they will all look the same, except for the from
address, which will have the funny word ( 'recursing_goldstine' ) in it. Match
those up, and give the kid the code.
