# Java CodeSpaces

You can work with the new Java Curriculum modules either by cloning the module and starting VSCode, or by starting a Github Codespace. 

1. Start from the repo page for one of the modules, such as [Level0-Module0](https://github.com/League-Java/Level0-Module0) 
1. **Fork.** Fork or Use the template.( Forking is actually easier because it sets the
name for you and allows updates. )
1. **Start Codespace.** Click on the green ``<> Code v`` button, then on the `Codespaces` tab.
Create a new Codespace on Master
1. **Run Some Code.** In the VSCode window, run your code! If you are in the Level0-Module0 repo, open `src/_02_code_flow/_1_robot_square/RobotSquare.java`, then either:
  * Click the run button in the upper right
  * Click on the Run/Debug icon in the left-side menu, then select "RobotSquare" from the
  pull down menu and click the run button. 
1. **Open VNC.** In the botton panel, lick on the `PORTS` tab, then Hover over
the cell for "Forwarded Address" and "VNC_Web (6080)".  You should get a
popup World Icon. Click on it to open a VNC window. 
  * **Or**, click on the third popup button, "Preview in Editor" to see a browser window in the VSCode editor. 
1. **Log In VNC.** The VNC password is "code4life"
